# BranDoMo-Diaster-Recovery-App
The DR application has two primary functions: to mitigate the response time emergency services take in remote villages/developing nations with limited access to internet and making it easier to account for those who are missing in the event of a large-scale disaster.

The DR application will be a mobile application strictly for Android devices. The application will use Google Map’s Application Programming Interface to send the user’s location to the intended party after pressing the distress button on the main screen of the application. The information that will be sent to the emergency responder will include the victim’s exact location, their name, and information relating to their emergency.
